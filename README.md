My entry to the Prefect 2.0 Code Contest launched just after Prefect 2.0's General Availability release.

This flow combines two things I have a strange fondness of:
- Prefect flow run names
- Craiyon ("DALLÂ·E mini") images

The flow takes the 5 latest flow run names and uses them as prompts for Craiyon.

Though not really identifying any Prefect edge cases, it's an example of using:
- Using native Python inside a flow
- Using Prefect's logger
- Mapping
- .submit()
- Interacting with PrefectFutures
- Interacting with the API
- Caching
- Task concurrency limits
